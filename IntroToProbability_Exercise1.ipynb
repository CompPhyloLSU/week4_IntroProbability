    "Let's create our own sample space using the Rev language. We'll begin by creating a vector in RevBayes. A vector is simply a list of values. To create a vector, we first give it a variable name (in this case, `sampleSpace`) and then assign the list of values to that variable name. An equals sign (_=_) is one of the assignment operators in RevBayes. It takes whatever is on the right and assigns it to the variable on the left. There are a few different ways to create a vector, but the simplest is probably to enclose a comma-separated list of values in square brackets [ . . . ]"

    "If we want to do something repetitious, like sample from our sample space many times, we'll want to use a construct called a `for` loop. `for` loops are ubiquitous across programming languages. They're structured so that they create a new variable (in this case, `i`) that takes on a different value every time you go through the code inside the loop. When you set up the loop, you both give the variable a name and you tell it what values you want it to take. In this case, we're taking advantage of some Rev shorthand (also used by R). If you type 1:4, it automatically creates a vector of all values between 1 and 4. This syntax is handy when you're dealing with consecutive integers. The code that is executed as part of the loop is contained inside curly braces `{ . . .}`. If the loop variable (e.g., `i`) is used in this code, it will change values every time you run through the loop. In the simple example below, we're just printing out the value of `i` every time we go through the loop."

These functions always have this form - `functionName()`. The name of the function is followed by parentheses. Most functions will also have options that affect how they run. These options can be changed by passing different arguments to a function. In that case, the syntax looks like this - `functionName(functionArguments)`. The possible arguments are always specific to that function. In our case, we're going to use a function called `runifInt()`. This name can be broken up into these three parts\n",

One last thing to note, though, is that even when you only want to sample a single value from this distribution, the result is _returned_ as a list. A _return_ value is the thing that a function hands back to you when you call it. Sometimes, we just want to pull that single number out by itself, so that it's not nested in a list. Because we know `runifInt()` will return a vector, we can add a vector index to pull out the single number."
