    "Even with 1,000 samples, our estimates still have some error, but let's take them as true for the moment. The estimates I obtained were 0.371, 0.179, 0.181, and 0.269. Because our four phenotypes are combinations of two binary traits (large v small, striped v spotted), we can ask whether the states of these characters are independent of one another or not.\n",

In our case, we can examine the independence of _large_ and _striped_.

We may know only the conditional probability on its own. We'll return to these ideas of conditional probability in a few weeks when we discuss Bayesian inference."
