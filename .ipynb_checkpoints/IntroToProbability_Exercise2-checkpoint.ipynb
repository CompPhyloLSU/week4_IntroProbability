The long-run frequency is the frequency of an event over a very large number of trials. So, the frequencies above (from 100 samples) are estimates of each event's true probability. However, because we have only drawn a finite number of samples (e.g., 100), our estimates have some error. The fact that our estimates become more precise as we draw more samples is known as the [Law of Large Numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers).
